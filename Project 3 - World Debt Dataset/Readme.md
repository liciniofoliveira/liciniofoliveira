In this project, i use Python to analyze world debt data from various countries to gain insights and visualize trends. I use popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas and Numpy to process, clean and visualize the data.
In this project i included my Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step analysis.

## These are some plots we can find in the analysis:
