### The Questions

Two questions will guide their future marketing program:
1) How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2) Why would casual riders want to acquire Cyclistic annual plans?

## The Prepare Phase

The preparation phase of data analysis involves data preparation, which includes collecting and selecting the relevant data needed to solve the problem at hand. In this phase, it is important to identify the key metrics required for the analysis and determine where the data is located, whether it is internal or external to the organization.

## The Analysis Phase

In the analysis, we aim to answer several questions regarding the usage of Cyclistic bikes. Through the examination of various data points, including ride length, distance, speed, user type, and ride frequency, we will uncover insights into how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. We will also explore why casual riders may want to acquire Cyclistic annual plans and how Cyclistic can use digital media to influence casual riders to become members. By using R language, Tableau, and PowerBI, we will examine the data from different angles to provide a comprehensive understanding of Cyclistic's bike share program. 

## Conclusions
Based on the analysis of the Cyclistic bike-share data, annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently in terms of frequency and duration of rides.

Firstly, annual members use Cyclistic bikes much more frequently than casual riders. The data shows that annual members took 463,744 rides while casual riders only took 130,757 rides in the given period.

Secondly, the data by user_type and day_of_week shows that casual riders tend to use Cyclistic bikes more on weekends, while annual members tend to use the service more on weekdays. Additionally, the average ride distance by user type and month shows that casual riders tend to take shorter rides compared to annual members.

These insights suggest that casual riders may be using Cyclistic bikes for leisure or short trips, while annual members may be using the service for daily commutes or longer rides.

As for why casual riders would want to acquire Cyclistic annual plans, the data suggests that they may benefit from the cost savings associated with a long-term commitment. The average ride length by user type shows that annual members tend to take longer rides, which could indicate that they are taking advantage of the benefits of the annual plan, such as lower cost per ride. Additionally, the data on ride frequency by day of the week shows that annual members tend to use the service more on weekdays, which could indicate that they are using Cyclistic bikes for daily commutes.

Overall, the data suggests that annual members and casual riders have different usage patterns and needs when it comes to using Cyclistic bikes. Understanding these patterns and needs can help Cyclistic develop targeted marketing and promotional strategies to attract and retain both types of riders.

One possible reason for casual riders to acquire Cyclistic annual plans is that it could offer a cost-effective option for more frequent use of the bikes. By subscribing to an annual plan, casual riders could potentially save money on individual rides and have the convenience of being able to use the bikes whenever they want without worrying about rental fees. Additionally, if Cyclistic were to offer incentives or rewards for frequent riders, such as discounts on future rentals or access to exclusive events or promotions, it could also be an appealing reason for casual riders to acquire annual plans.
